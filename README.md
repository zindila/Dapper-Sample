Dapper is a micro-ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library for .NET that provides a simple and efficient way to work with databases.
With Dapper, you can easily execute SQL queries and map the results to .NET objects
 In practice, using Dapper involves establishing a connection to the database, 
 executing SQL commands (such as insert, update, delete, or select queries) using the Query or Execute methods, and mapping the results to .NET objects
